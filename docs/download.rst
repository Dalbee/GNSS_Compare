The latest Android PacKage (APK) to download and install on your phone always available:

 `Download <https://github.com/TheGalfins/GNSS_Compare/raw/master/release_apk/GNSS_Compare.apk>`_.

Please note that you need Android 7.0+ to run the application. Also, please note that not all Android 7.0+ phones support the Galileo Satellite System. The list of Galileo compatible phones can be found `here <http://galileognss.eu/is-your-phone-using-galileo/>`_.

So far we've been testing the application on:

- Samsung Galaxy S8
- Samsung Galaxy S8+

And we are very happy with the results!
