The latest, beta version Android package (APK) to download and install GNSS Compare on your phone is always available `here <https://github.com/TheGalfins/GNSS_Compare/raw/master/release_apk/GNSS_Compare.apk>`_.

Please note that you need Android 7.0+ to run the application. Also, please note that not all Android 7.0+ phones support the Galileo Satellite System. The list of Galileo compatible phones can be found `here <http://galileognss.eu/is-your-phone-using-galileo/>`_.

So far we've been testing the application on:

- Samsung Galaxy S8
- Samsung Galaxy S8+
- Samsung Galaxy Note 8

And we are very happy with the results!
