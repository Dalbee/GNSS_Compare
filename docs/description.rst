The purpose of GNSS Compare is to make the life of developers and reasearchers easier. It's an easy to use and easy to extend Android-based framework for calculating the :ref:`PVT<pvt>` based on raw GNSS measurements.


Project history
===============

GNSS Compare is the *Winning* Android application developed by the Galfins as part of the internal `European Space Agency`_ (ESA) competition called `Galileo Smartphone App Challenge`_ introduced in November 2017. The Challenge was about creating a smartphone application, which will allow the user to choose which satellite constellation to use for :ref:`Position, Velocity and Time<pvt>` estimation. The aim was to increase the awareness about ESA's `Galileo programme`_ and also to allow users from common public to compare the performance of Galileo signals with the performance from other global satellite navigation constellations.
