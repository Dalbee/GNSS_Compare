Project history
===============

GNSS Compare is an Android application developed by the Galfins as part of the internal ESA_ competition called Galileo Smartphone App Challenge introduced in November 2017. The Challenge was about creating a smartphone application, which will allow the user to choose which satellite constellation to use for :ref:`Position, Velocity and Time` estimation. The aim was to increase the awareness about ESA's `Galileo programme`_ and also to allow users from common public to compare the performance of Galileo signals with the performance from other global satellite navigation constellations.
