We would like to mention the libraries that we are using in the *GNSS Compare* software framework:

- `Efficient Java Matrix Library`_ (EJML) for linear algebra operations,

- `goGPS`_ for GNSS related computations (satellite coordinates and velocities, etc.),

- `GNSS Logger`_ for using the raw data logging format as a feature.

Also we would like to thank the European Space Agency for the continuous support throughout the development of this application. Especially we would like to mention the ESA employees that shared their experience and knowledge with us: Paolo Crosta, Nityaporn Sirikan, Gaetano Galluzzo and Paolo Zoccarato.
