In this section we have put some links that can be useful for the competitors of the  `2nd Edition of the Galileo Android App Competition <https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/European_students_and_researchers_compete_in_our_new_Galileo_app_competition>`_  (ran by the European Space Agency (ESA), European GNSS Agency (GSA), European Commision (EC) and supported also by Google):

Example of proposal
======================

Feel free to use our original proposal, which we have submitted to the `first edition of the Galileo Android App Competition <https://m.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/ESA_trainees_compete_in_inaugural_Galileo_app_contest>`_, as a source of inspiration. It's available to download :download:`here <The_Galfins_proposal_full.pdf>`. Just remember - our idea has changed in the course of the project, so not everything in that document is up to date!
