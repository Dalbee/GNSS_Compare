Example of analysis
*******************

This section provides information about the scenarios in which GNSS Compare was tested and the PVT performance
obtained from its estimation algorithms (e.g., Extended Kalman Filter). Furthermore, the analysis
presented here serves also as an example of how GNSS Compare can be used for algorithmic performance assessment.
For a preliminary PVT performance assessment the following scenarios were considered: Static user case,
Pedestrian user case and Dynamic user case.
