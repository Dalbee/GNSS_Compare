Example of analysis
*******************

This section provides information about the scenarios in which *GNSS Compare* was tested and the PVT performance
obtained from its estimation algorithms (e.g., Extended Kalman Filter). Furthermore, the analysis
presented here serves also as an example of how GNSS Compare can be used for algorithmic performance assessment.
For a preliminary PVT performance assessment the following scenarios were considered: **Static user case**,
 **Pedestrian user case** and **Dynamic user case**.

With this section we would like to give you an idea of how *GNSS Compare* can be used. The application allows
data logging (e.g., results of the PVT estimations) in different formats, like NMEA and a custom one. These files
can be retrieved from the phone and then processed in your favourit programming environment for analysis. More details about the
logging formats of *GNSS Compare* will be given soon.
