Work in progress...

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gnss-compare/badge/?version=latest)](https://gnss-compare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Check out the [docs](https://gnss-compare.readthedocs.io).

Or dive straight into using the app. Now available in [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.galfins.gnss_compare).


The main ``app`` module of this work is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

The ``gogpsextracts`` module, is strongly based on the [goGPS Project](https://github.com/goGPS-Project/) and is released under the LGPL 3.0 license.

Todos:
- Refactor the code 
- Add tests
- Add [Google Play Scraper](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper) or something similar to show app status from the Play store.
